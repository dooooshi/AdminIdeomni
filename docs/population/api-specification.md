# Population System API Specification

## Automatic Population Updates

The population system **automatically recalculates** populations whenever any operation affects them. Manual recalculation is NOT needed for normal operations.

### Operations That Trigger Automatic Updates

#### Facility Operations
- **Facility Build Completion**: Automatically updates tile and all affected neighbors/influence range
- **Facility Upgrade**: Automatically recalculates based on level changes and range expansion
- **Facility Demolition**: Automatically removes influence and updates all affected tiles

#### Infrastructure Operations  
- **Water/Power Connection**: Automatically enables production bonuses for all facilities
- **Water/Power Disconnection**: Automatically removes ALL production bonuses immediately
- **Base/Fire Station Service Change**: Automatically updates production bonus eligibility

#### Automatic Update Scope
| Operation | Tiles Auto-Updated | Reason |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Build RAW_MATERIAL facility | Self only | Production bonus is local |
| Build FUNCTIONAL facility | Self only | Production bonus is local |
| Build Level 1 growth facility | Self only | Influence range = 1 tile |
| Build Level 2 growth facility | Self + 6 neighbors | Influence range = 7 tiles |
| Build Level 3 growth facility | Self + 18 neighbors | Influence range = 19 tiles |
| Build Level 4 growth facility | Self + 36 neighbors | Influence range = 37 tiles |
| Upgrade facility to Level 3+ | 6 neighbors | Siphonâ†’Spillover effect change |
| Upgrade growth facility level | Expanding influence area | Range expansion |
| Infrastructure connect | All production facilities | Enables bonuses |
| Infrastructure disconnect | All production facilities | Disables ALL bonuses |
| Demolish any facility | All previously affected | Removes all influences |

### Implementation Note
Population updates are triggered through event listeners on:
- `FacilityService` events (build, upgrade, demolish)
- `InfrastructureConnectionService` events (connect, disconnect)
- `InfrastructureServiceService` events (subscribe, cancel)

## Base URL
```
/api/population
```

## Authentication
All endpoints require JWT authentication with appropriate role permissions.

## Population Update Events

The system emits these events for real-time updates:

### WebSocket Events
```typescript
// Population changed on a tile
{
  "event": "population.changed",
  "data": {
    "tileId": 123,
    "activityId": "activity_abc",
    "previousPopulation": 3200,
    "newPopulation": 5420,
    "changeType": "FACILITY_UPGRADE"
  }
}

// Population milestone reached
{
  "event": "population.milestone",
  "data": {
    "tileId": 123,
    "milestone": 10000,
    "teamId": "team_001"
  }
}
```

## Error Responses

### 400 Bad Request

  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_TILE_ID",
    "message": "The specified tile ID does not exist"
  }
}
```

### 403 Forbidden
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS",

  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint Type | Limit |
|--------------|-------|
| Population queries | 100 requests/minute |
| Manual adjustments | 5 requests/minute |
| Force recalculate | 2 requests/minute |

## Permissions

| Endpoint | Required Role | Scope |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| GET /api/population/tile/:tileId | Any authenticated user | Tile must be in user's activity |
| GET /api/population/history/:tileId | Any authenticated user | Tile must be in user's activity |
| GET /api/population/my-activity/history | Manager only | Automatically scoped to manager's activity |
| GET /api/population/my-activity/team-summary | Manager only | Automatically scoped to manager's activity |
| GET /api/population/influence/:facilityId | Any authenticated user | Facility must be in user's activity |
| GET /api/population/influence-map/:tileId | Any authenticated user | Tile must be in user's activity |
| PUT /api/population/manual-adjustment | Admin only | Any activity |
| POST /api/population/force-recalculate | Admin only | Any activity |

### Manager-Specific Access Rights
Managers have enhanced access to population data for their activity (automatically determined from authentication context):
- **Activity-wide History**: Can view all population changes across their entire activity
- **Team Summaries**: Can see aggregated population data by team
- **No activityId Required**: Activity is automatically resolved from manager's context
- **Filtering Capabilities**: Can filter history by team, tile, change type, and date range
- **Performance Metrics**: Can track recent population changes and team performance

### Admin Access
Admins who need to access specific activities should use admin-specific endpoints that include activityId in the path (to be implemented separately).

## Integration with Existing Services

### Facility Service Integration
```typescript
// Automatically triggered on facility events
facilityService.on('facility.built', async (event) => {
  await populationService.handleFacilityBuilt(event);
});

facilityService.on('facility.upgraded', async (event) => {
  await populationService.handleFacilityUpgraded(event);
});

facilityService.on('facility.demolished', async (event) => {
  await populationService.handleFacilityDemolished(event);
});
```

### Infrastructure Service Integration
```typescript
// Automatically triggered on infrastructure events
infrastructureService.on('connection.established', async (event) => {
  await populationService.handleInfrastructureConnected(event);
});

infrastructureService.on('connection.lost', async (event) => {
  await populationService.handleInfrastructureDisconnected(event);
});
```

## Important Notes

1. **Automatic Updates**: Population is automatically recalculated when facilities or infrastructure change. Manual recalculation is only for debugging.

2. **Transaction Safety**: All population updates happen within database transactions with the triggering operation.

3. **Event-Driven**: The system uses event listeners to trigger updates, ensuring consistency.

4. **Performance**: Batch updates are optimized to process multiple tiles efficiently.

5. **Audit Trail**: Every population change is recorded in history with the triggering operation.
