# MTO Type 2: MALL-Based Competitive Bidding System

## Executive Summary

MTO Type 2 is a marketplace-driven Made-To-Order procurement system exclusive to teams operating MALL facilities. Unlike the population-based distribution of Type 1, Type 2 creates a competitive bidding environment where MALL operators submit products with self-determined pricing, competing for procurement budgets that are dynamically allocated based on MALL location populations at settlement time.

## Background

### Target Users
- **Primary Users**: Teams with MALL facilities (entrepreneurs managing retail infrastructure)
- **Secondary Users**: Game managers (configuring procurement requirements and monitoring market dynamics)
- **System Users**: Automated budget distribution and settlement systems

### Expected Impact
- **Business Metrics**:
  - Enhanced competitive dynamics through price-based competition
  - Strategic MALL placement incentivization in high-population areas
  - Market efficiency through supply-demand price discovery
  - Increased revenue opportunities for efficient producers
- **User Benefits**:
  - Freedom to set competitive pricing strategies
  - Direct control over profit margins
  - Rewards for efficient production and strategic facility placement
  - Clear market feedback through settlement results
- **Technical Benefits**:
  - Dynamic budget allocation algorithm
  - Efficient price-based sorting and fulfillment
  - Scalable settlement processing for multiple MALLs

## System Overview

MTO Type 2 implements a sophisticated competitive marketplace where:
1. Only teams with **MALL facilities** can participate in procurement
2. Teams submit products to their MALLs with **self-determined unit prices**
3. At settlement, budgets are **dynamically allocated** based on MALL tile populations
4. Products are purchased in **price order** (lowest first) until budget exhaustion
5. Teams can retrieve unsettled products post-settlement

### Critical Distinctions from Type 1
- **Participation**: Restricted to MALL owners vs. open to all teams
- **Pricing**: Market-driven (teams set prices) vs. fixed procurement price
- **Distribution**: Competitive bidding vs. guaranteed demand per tile
- **Risk**: Teams bear inventory risk vs. guaranteed purchase up to requirements
- **Strategy**: Price optimization and MALL placement vs. production and logistics

### Platform Integration Requirements
- **Facility Management**: Verification of MALL ownership and capacity
- **Manager Product Formula**: Exact specification matching (identical to Type 1)
- **Team Account Module**: Payment processing and transaction management
- **Transportation System**: Product delivery to MALLs and unsettled returns

## Key Features

### 1. MALL-Exclusive Participation

### 2. Competitive Price Mechanism
- Teams set individual unit prices for submissions
- No price floors or ceilings (pure market dynamics)
- **Submissions are final** - no modifications or withdrawals allowed
- Price visibility restrictions until settlement
- Historical price analytics for strategy optimization

### 3. Dynamic Budget Distribution
- Real-time population calculation for MALL tiles
- Proportional budget allocation based on population ratios
- Fair opportunity for all MALL locations

- Within same level, sorted by unit price (ascending)
- Sequential purchase until budget depletion
- Partial order fulfillment support
- Clear settlement priority visibility

### 5. Settlement Processing
