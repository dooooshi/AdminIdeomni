# MTO Type 2 Documentation Update Summary

## Date: 2025-09-19

## Documentation Review Completed

### Files Reviewed:
1. `README.md` - Main documentation
2. `data-model.md` - Data model specifications
3. `business-rules.md` - Business logic documentation
4. `api-specification.md` - API endpoints
5. `i18n-design.md` - Internationalization
6. `integration.md` - System integration

### Updates Made:

#### 1. README.md
**Added**: Implementation Status section
- Clear breakdown of completed vs pending features
- Highlighted that settlement logic is not yet implemented (TODO at line 570)
- Listed development priorities
- Added notes about documentation vs requirements discrepancy

#### 2. business-rules.md
**Added**: Clarification note about MALL level priority
- Highlighted discrepancy between original requirements (price-only) and documentation (MALL level + price)
- Added warning that clarification is needed from product team

### Key Findings:

#### Implementation Gaps:
1. **Settlement Logic**: Core functionality not implemented (has TODO comment)
2. **Budget Allocation**: Population-based distribution algorithm missing
3. **Price Ordering**: Sorting logic not coded
4. **Formula Validation**: Product validation against manager formula missing
5. **Payment Processing**: Team account integration incomplete
6. **Return Process**: Unsettled product returns not implemented

#### Documentation Issues:
1. **MALL Level Priority**: Documentation includes MALL level priority but original requirements only specify price-based ordering
2. **Implementation Status**: Documentation didn't indicate that most features are unimplemented

### Compliance Report Created:
- Created `/docs/mto/mto-type2-compliance-report.md`
- Shows ~30% implementation completion
- Identifies all gaps and priorities

### Recommendations:

#### For Development Team:
1. **Urgent**: Implement settlement algorithm (highest priority)
2. **Clarify**: Confirm if MALL level should be considered or pure price-based ordering
3. **Complete**: Formula validation and payment integration
4. **Add**: Return process with transportation fees

#### For Documentation Team:
1. **Maintain**: Keep Implementation Status section updated as features are completed
2. **Resolve**: Get clarification on MALL level vs price-only ordering
3. **Add**: Testing documentation and validation scenarios

## Summary:

The MTO Type 2 documentation is comprehensive and well-structured, but the implementation is only ~30% complete with the critical settlement functionality missing. The documentation has been updated to clearly reflect the current implementation status and highlight areas needing clarification.
