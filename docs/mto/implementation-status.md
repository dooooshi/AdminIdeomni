## 🎯 Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **Student MTO Type 1 Market View** - Essential for teams to see requirements
2. **Student MTO Type 1 Delivery Form** - Essential for teams to submit products
3. **Manager Settlement Trigger** - Essential to complete the workflow

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)
1. **Tile Distribution View** - Important for transparency
2. **Analytics Dashboard** - Important for monitoring
3. **MTO Type 2 Manager Components** - Complete Type 2 functionality

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Real-time updates**
2. **Export functionality**
3. **Advanced filtering**

## 📝 Technical Debt
1. **Activity ID Hardcoding**: Currently hardcoded as 'default-activity' in pages
2. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling, needs improvement
3. **Loading States**: Needs skeleton loaders for better UX
4. **Form Validation**: Could be more comprehensive
5. **Test Coverage**: No tests written yet

## 🚀 Next Steps

To complete the MTO system implementation:

1. **Phase 1: Core Student Features** (1-2 days)
   - Create MTO market view page
   - Create delivery submission form
   - Implement basic delivery tracking

2. **Phase 2: Settlement & Analytics** (1-2 days)
   - Add settlement trigger for managers
   - Create basic analytics dashboard
   - Implement settlement history view

3. **Phase 3: MTO Type 2** (2-3 days)
   - Implement all Type 2 manager components
   - Implement MALL owner interfaces
   - Add competitive bidding logic

4. **Phase 4: Polish & Optimization** (1 day)
   - Add loading states and skeletons
   - Improve error handling
   - Add export functionality
   - Write tests

## Conclusion
The MTO system foundation is solid with complete data models, API services, and basic manager interfaces for Type 1. The primary gap is student-facing features for Type 1 and all Type 2 features. With the existing infrastructure, completing the remaining features should be straightforward.
