# Infrastructure Feature - Requirements Analysis

## Problem Statement

### Current Situation
The business simulation platform currently allows teams to build various facilities (Raw Material Production, Functional, etc.) on the hexagonal map. However, these facilities operate independently without realistic resource dependencies, reducing the strategic depth and realism of the simulation.

### Problem to Solve
Real-world facilities require essential infrastructure services to operate - water, power, telecommunications, and safety services. The absence of these dependencies creates an unrealistic simulation where:
- Teams can build facilities anywhere without considering infrastructure availability
- No resource management or allocation decisions are required
- Limited opportunities for inter-team cooperation and resource trading
- Reduced strategic complexity in facility placement and expansion

### Business Opportunity
Introducing infrastructure dependencies will:
- Create more realistic business simulation scenarios
- Add strategic depth through resource management
- Enable new cooperation and competition dynamics between teams
- Provide educational value about infrastructure planning and resource allocation

#### Educational Facilitators
**Needs:**
- Teaching opportunities about resource management
- Demonstrable cause-and-effect relationships
- Measurable learning outcomes

## Requirements Gathering

### Functional Requirements

#### Infrastructure Types
Based on realistic business needs, four essential infrastructure types are required:

1. **Water Infrastructure (WATER_PLANT)**
   - Essential for all production and functional facilities
   - Limited by physical distribution capacity
   - Distance affects distribution cost

2. **Power Infrastructure (POWER_PLANT)**
   - Required for facility operations
   - Capacity constraints based on generation capability
   - Distribution network limitations

3. **Telecommunications (BASE_STATION)**
   - Enables facility coordination and operations
   - Coverage area based on signal strength
   - No physical connection required

4. **Safety Services (FIRE_STATION)**
   - Provides emergency response coverage
   - Service area based on response time
   - Protects facility investments

#### Connection Mechanics
Two distinct infrastructure delivery models:

1. **Physical Connection Model** (Water/Power)
   - Requires physical infrastructure (pipes/lines)
   - Distance increases cost and complexity
   - Limited by capacity (action points)
   - Cannot cross certain terrain (MARINE)

2. **Coverage Area Model** (Telecom/Safety)
   - Wireless or response-based coverage
   - Service area increases with facility level
   - No capacity constraints within coverage

#### Team Cooperation
- Cross-team infrastructure sharing capabilities
- Service pricing and negotiation mechanisms
- Request and approval workflows
- Revenue generation opportunities

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Real-time connection validation
- Efficient path calculation for hundreds of connections
- Minimal impact on existing game performance

#### Usability
- Intuitive visualization of infrastructure connections
- Clear feedback on facility operational status
- Simple approval workflows for service sharing

#### Scalability
- Support for 50+ teams per activity
- Hundreds of facilities and connections
- Extensible for future infrastructure types

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing hexagonal grid system
- Utilize current facility and team management systems
- Work within existing authentication and authorization framework
- Support multi-language interface (English/Chinese)

### Business Constraints
- Cannot fundamentally change existing game mechanics
- Must be configurable per activity/difficulty level
- Should not create insurmountable barriers for new players
- Must maintain game balance and fairness

### Assumptions
- All facilities require all four infrastructure types to operate
- Teams will engage in infrastructure sharing when beneficial
- Distance-based costs create meaningful strategic decisions
- Infrastructure placement becomes a key strategic consideration

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- 80% of student teams engage in infrastructure planning within first 3 rounds
- 50% of teams participate in cross-team infrastructure sharing
- Average of 3+ strategic infrastructure decisions per team per round
- Less than 10% increase in turn processing time
- 90% of students demonstrate understanding of infrastructure concepts

### Qualitative Metrics
- Players report increased strategic depth
- Infrastructure decisions create meaningful trade-offs
- Inter-team negotiations become common
- Educational value in resource management demonstrated

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Path calculation performance**: Mitigate with caching and optimization
- **Complex state management**: Clear connection tracking and validation
- **Integration complexity**: Phased rollout with feature flags

### Business Risks
- **Increased complexity for student teams**: Provide tutorials and guided learning paths

- **Reduced game pace**: Optimize workflows and provide automation options
- **Learning curve too steep**: Progressive difficulty options

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive configuration options
- Create clear visualization and feedback systems
- Provide both simple and advanced gameplay modes
- Include infrastructure automation for beginners

## Initial Requirements Priority
