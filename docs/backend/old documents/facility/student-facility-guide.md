## Step-by-Step Building Guide

### Step 1: Research Available Facilities

Before building, explore what's available for your activity:

```bash
# Using curl (for advanced users)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:2999/api/user/facility-configs/summary" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Or use the web interface:
# Navigate to: Business Activity â†’ Facilities â†’ Available Configurations
```

**What to Look For:**
- Facilities compatible with your owned land types
- Build costs vs. your team's current resources
- Upgrade potential for long-term growth
- Maximum instances allowed per tile

### Step 2: Check Your Resources

Always verify your team's resource balance before planning builds:

```bash
# Check team resources
curl -X GET "http://localhost:2999/api/user/facilities/summary" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Resource Planning Tips:**
- Keep 20% of resources in reserve for emergencies
- Plan multiple facilities together for cost efficiency
- Consider upgrade costs in your planning

### Step 3: Validate Build Capability

Use the validation endpoint to check if you can build before attempting:

```bash
# Validate building a MINE on tile 5
curl -X GET "http://localhost:2999/api/user/facilities/validate-build/5/MINE" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Validation Response Interpretation:**
- `canBuild: true` - You're ready to build
- `canBuild: false` - Check the `errors` array for issues
- Review `costs` and `resources` sections for planning

### Step 4: Build Your Facility

Once validation passes, proceed with the build:

```bash
# Build a MINE on tile 5
curl -X POST "http://localhost:2999/api/user/facilities/build" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tileId": 5,
    "facilityType": "MINE",
    "description": "Primary gold mining operation",
    "maxGoldCost": 250.0,
    "maxCarbonCost": 100.0
  }'
```

**Build Parameters Explained:**
- `tileId`: The tile number where you want to build
- `facilityType`: Exact facility type (case-sensitive)
- `description`: Optional description for your records
- `maxGoldCost`/`maxCarbonCost`: Price protection limits (optional but recommended)

### Step 5: Monitor Construction

After building, verify the facility was created successfully:

```bash
# Check your team's facilities
curl -X GET "http://localhost:2999/api/user/facilities/owned" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Upgrading Facilities

### Understanding Upgrade Costs

Facility upgrades use progressive cost calculations:

**Formula**: `Upgrade Cost = Base Cost Ã— (Multiplier ^ (Level - 1))`

**Example: MINE Upgrade (Base: 150 Gold, 60 Carbon, Multiplier: 1.6)**
- Level 1â†’2: 150 Gold, 60 Carbon (210 total)
- Level 2â†’3: 240 Gold, 96 Carbon (336 total)
- Level 3â†’4: 384 Gold, 154 Carbon (538 total)

### Upgrade Process

#### Step 1: Calculate Upgrade Costs

```bash
# Calculate costs to upgrade MINE from level 1 to 3
curl -X GET "http://localhost:2999/api/user/facility-configs/upgrade-costs?facilityType=MINE&fromLevel=1&toLevel=3" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

#### Step 2: Perform the Upgrade

```bash
# Upgrade facility to level 3
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:2999/api/user/facilities/FACILITY_ID/upgrade" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "targetLevel": 3,
    "maxUpgradeCost": 600.0
  }'
```

**Upgrade Tips:**
- Always use `maxUpgradeCost` for price protection
- Upgrade facilities with low multipliers first (FARM: 1.2x)
- Plan upgrade timing around resource abundance
- Focus on facilities with immediate impact

## Strategic Facility Management

### Beginner Strategy (First 5 Facilities)

1. **PARK** (PLAIN) - Learn the system, low cost
2. **FARM** (COASTAL/PLAIN) - Essential food production
3. **WAREHOUSE** (COASTAL/PLAIN) - Support operations
4. **MINE** or **QUARRY** (PLAIN) - Resource generation
5. **FACTORY** (COASTAL/PLAIN) - Value-added production

**Budget Allocation:**
- 60% on production facilities (FARM, MINE)
- 25% on functional facilities (WAREHOUSE, FACTORY)
- 15% kept in reserve

### Intermediate Strategy (6-12 Facilities)

**Phase 2 Expansion:**
6. **WATER_PLANT** - Essential infrastructure
7. **FISHERY** (if coastal land available)
8. **MALL** - Retail operations

- Focus on low-cost, reliable facilities
- Upgrade slowly and systematically

#### Balanced Approach (Medium Risk)
- Keep 20% resources in reserve  
- Mix of production and functional facilities
- Strategic upgrades based on ROI
- Moderate expansion pace

#### Aggressive Approach (High Risk)
- Keep 10% resources in reserve
- Fast expansion with high-value facilities
- Quick upgrades to maximize returns
- Accept higher risk for faster growth

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures

#### "Team does not own land on this tile"
**Solution:**
1. Verify tile ownership: Check land management section
2. Purchase land on the target tile
3. Choose a different tile where your team owns land

#### "Insufficient gold/carbon"
**Solution:**
1. Check current team balance
2. Request resource transfer from team members
3. Choose a cheaper facility type
4. Wait for resource accumulation

#### "Facility not allowed on this land type"
**Solutions:**
1. Check facility-land compatibility:
   - MARINE: FISHERY, WATER_PLANT, BASE_STATION
   - COASTAL: FISHERY, FARM, FACTORY, MALL, WAREHOUSE, HOSPITAL
   - PLAIN: Most facilities (16 types)
2. Choose compatible facility for land type
3. Find tiles with compatible land type

#### "Maximum instances reached"
**Solution:**
1. Check current facility count on tile
2. Some facilities have instance limits (usually 1-3 per tile)
3. Choose different tile or facility type

### Upgrade Issues

#### "Facility not owned by team"
**Solution:**
1. Verify facility ownership in team facility list
2. Ensure you're upgrading team facilities, not other teams'
3. Check facility ID accuracy

#### "Target level exceeds maximum"
**Solution:**
1. Check facility's maximum level in configurations
2. Choose appropriate target level
3. Some facilities have limited upgrade potential

#### "Price protection exceeded"
**Solution:**
1. Increase `maxUpgradeCost` parameter
2. Upgrade to lower level first
3. Check actual costs vs. expectations
